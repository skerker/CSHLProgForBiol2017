Write a python program that reads in the 'bowtie2.bam' file, and generates a table containing the number of reads mapped to each gene.

-add info on formatting, extracting the gene identifier.


-advanced: compute reads per transcript instead of reads per gene.  split multi-mapped reads accross transcripts.
